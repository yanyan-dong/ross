This opportunity is not directly related to mining but may apply to mining-related innovations in regional development strategies.
The **NSF Regional Innovation Engines** program (NSF 24-565) does not explicitly focus on **mining** or **mineral resources**, but it could still be relevant depending on how the proposed project ties into **regional innovation ecosystems** and **technological advancements** in those fields.

### How it Might Relate to Mining and Mineral Resources:
1. **Technological Advancements**: If your project focuses on innovations in **mining technology**, **sustainable extraction**, **mineral processing**, or **rare earth elements recovery**, it could align with the program’s goal to accelerate key technologies and address regional and national challenges.

2. **Economic Growth in Resource-Rich Regions**: Regions with strong mining and mineral resource industries could benefit from the **innovation ecosystems** this program aims to build. Projects that foster **sustainable mining practices**, create **new technologies for resource management**, or drive **economic growth in mining communities** could fit the program's objectives.

3. **STEM and Workforce Development**: If your proposal includes components that enhance **STEM education**, **workforce development**, and **entrepreneurship** in the mining sector, it could align well with the program’s emphasis on creating pathways to careers in **critical industries**.

### Conclusion:
While the program doesn't specifically mention **mining** or **mineral resources**, it is broad enough to support projects that focus on **innovations** in these areas, especially if the project contributes to **regional economic development**, **technological growth**, or **national competitiveness**. If your proposal addresses these goals in the context of mining and mineral resources, it may be a suitable fit for this funding opportunity.
