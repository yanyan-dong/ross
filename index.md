There are several relevant funding opportunities for the researcher focused on mining, mineral resources, infrastructure, and large-scale collaborative projects:

1. **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)**
   - **Funder**: Department of Defense (DOD)
   - **Opportunity ID**: W912HZ-24-BAA-01
   - **Link**: [Pivot-RP](https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/648388d2-2449-497f-9b13-d1d75de8f0f3)
   - **Deadline**: December 31, 2024
   - **Funding Scope**: Covers diverse areas like geotechnical engineering, earthquake engineering, remote sensing, and military engineering, which may align with research on mining infrastructure and innovation.
   - **Eligibility**: Academic institutions, government, non-profit, and commercial/private sectors based in the U.S.
   - **Relevance**: The researcher could explore collaborations with ERDC in areas such as geotechnical engineering or remote sensing, both of which are relevant to mining infrastructure.

2. **National Science Foundation (NSF) - Engineering for Civil Infrastructure (ECI)**
   - **Funder**: NSF
   - **Funder ID**: PD 19-073Y
   - **Link**: [Pivot-RP](https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/ffcb48b4-7aa0-47a2-9b3d-d1d75de8f0f3)
   - **Deadline**: Rolling (Confirmed)
   - **Eligibility**: U.S.-based academic institutions and non-profit organizations.
   - **Funding Scope**: Supports research on physical infrastructure (e.g., underground facilities, geostructures) and encourages collaboration across fields like robotics, materials science, and construction processes.
   - **Relevance**: The researcher's interest in mining and mineral resources infrastructure fits within this program, particularly with a focus on geotechnical and construction engineering.

3. **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) - National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (NGGDPP)**
   - **Funder**: U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)
   - **Funder ID**: G25AS00009

   - **Deadline**: December 12, 2024
   - **Funding Range**: $5,000 - $800,000
   - **Eligibility**: State geological surveys (universities may apply on behalf of state geological surveys).
   - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant for the researcher’s interests in mining and mineral resources as it focuses on the preservation and cataloging of geological and geophysical data.

4. **DOE - Advancing Technology Development for Securing a Domestic Supply of Critical Minerals and Materials (CMM)**
   - **Funder**: Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)
   - **Funder ID**: DE-FOA-0002956
   - **Link**: [Pivot-RP](https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/de383c2f-ac94-48de-808d-f2f1552f7976)
   - **Deadline**: November 26, 2024
   - **Funding Upper Limit**: $3,750,000
   - **Eligibility**: Domestic entities such as academic institutions and industries.
   - **Relevance**: Directly targets the researcher’s focus on critical minerals and innovation in mining technologies, aiming at the development of technologies for the recovery of critical minerals from unconventional sources.

These opportunities align well with the researcher's focus on mining, mineral resources, infrastructure, and large-scale collaborative projects. Each offers potential for funding projects that range from infrastructure development to innovative mineral recovery technologies.
